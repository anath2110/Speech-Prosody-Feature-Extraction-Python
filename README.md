# prosodyMonsterPython
Extracting Prosody Features From Speech Audios.
This is a simplified version of the "monster" code used in "Python_stance-midlevel" repository.
Can be used both for monos and stereos but only .wav files(for now).
Includes codes to get the means and standard deviation of the extracted features.
Also, code for normalizing the features is included.
