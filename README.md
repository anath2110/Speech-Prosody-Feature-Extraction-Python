# Extracting only low-level prosody features from speech audios with Python
<br> Low-level features: 6 (absolute pitch in log Hz, relative pitch which is z-normalized pitch,energy, cepstral flux,speaking frames from pitch and speaking frames from energy.
<br> The approach implemented here can be used both with monos and stereos but only '.wav' files(for now).
<br> Also, includes codes to get the means and standard deviation and z normalizing the extracted prosody features.
